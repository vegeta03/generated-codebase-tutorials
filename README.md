# Generated Codebase Tutorials

A collection of in-depth tutorials on modern codebases, automatically generated using [AI Codebase Knowledge Generator](https://github.com/vegeta03/codebase-knowledge-generator).

## Overview

This repository contains comprehensive tutorials that break down complex codebases into digestible learning materials. Each tutorial explores architectural patterns, design decisions, and implementation details of real-world applications.

## Available Tutorials

### [Angular-NgRx-Nx Realworld Example App by GPT-4.1](./angular-ngrx-nx-realworld-example-app%20by%20gpt-4.1/index.md)

A detailed exploration of a Medium-like blogging platform built with:

- Modern Angular (zoneless, standalone components)
- NgRx Signal Store for state management
- Nx monorepo architecture
- Domain-driven design principles

This tutorial breaks down advanced patterns for reactive state management, API integration, error handling, and component architecture.

### [Angular-NgRx-Nx Realworld Example App by O4-Mini-High](./angular-ngrx-nx-realworld-example-app%20by%20o4-mini-high/index.md)

An alternative analysis of the same codebase with a focus on:

- Nx Monorepo workspace organization
- NgRx Signals for state management
- CallState pattern for tracking asynchronous operations
- API Client abstraction layer
- Authentication and article data management
- Smart vs. Dumb component patterns
- Form error handling mechanisms
- E2E testing with Playwright

This version provides additional insights into testing strategies and component architecture with 11 detailed chapters.

## How to Use

Each tutorial folder contains:

1. An `index.md` file providing an overview of the application
2. Individual chapter files exploring specific architectural aspects
3. Diagrams illustrating relationships between components
